# ADVANCE_COMPUTER_VISION

---

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to core computer vision concepts, covering image processing, feature extraction, object detection, camera calibration, and 3D reconstruction. It emphasizes both the mathematical foundations and practical implementation of vision algorithms using tools like **OpenCV** and **PyTorch**.

Students also explore deep learning methods for visual recognition, including CNNs for tasks such as object classification, segmentation, and facial recognition. Hands-on projects apply these techniques to real-world applications like autonomous systems, medical imaging, and augmented reality.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Image and video analysis
- Traditional and deep learning-based vision techniques
- 2D/3D vision methods (segmentation, depth estimation, 3D reconstruction)
- Real-time, interactive visual systems
- Application to fields such as robotics and AR

**Prerequisites:**
- Python programming
- Data structures
- Linear algebra and vector calculus
- (Helpful) Basic knowledge of AI or machine learning

**Course Objectives:**
- Master visual data processing concepts
- Apply machine learning and deep learning to vision problems
- Build and deploy interactive vision systems
- Analyze the practical challenges of deploying vision algorithms in real-world scenarios
